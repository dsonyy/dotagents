# Lessons index

Match the task to tags, open only the records that match. Never read `records/` wholesale.
Record shape: front matter `title` + `tags`, H1 equal to the title, then `**Context**:`,
optional `**Problem**:`, `**Rule**:`, `**Applies to**:`.
Run `python3 ~/lessons/check.py` after editing anything here.

## Tags

One to four per record, from this list only. `check.py` reads the block below, so the fence
and one-tag-per-line shape are load-bearing. A near-synonym of an existing tag makes older
lessons unfindable, so adding one is a deliberate edit.
